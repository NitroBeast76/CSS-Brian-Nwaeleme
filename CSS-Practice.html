        <h4><b><u>Projects</u></b></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4><b><u>Manuludus</u></b></h4> <p>Manuludus is a program that is built to simulate the actions a gamer performs on a daily. It is desgined to observe the player's actions such as clicking, moving, using and pressing buttons etc, and then automates them. It also has an inbuilt GPT which when accessed is used to produce algorithms that will essentially allow the player to go on autopilot for as long as he/she wishes.</p>
                <p>Benefits: Manuludus possess several benefits such as being able to perform repetitive actions and also give the player an opportunity to sit back and relax. it also allows the user to perform AFK activites more efficiently.</p>
                <p>Features: This program is able to perform multiple actions at once, such as pressing a combination of different keys, it also possess a timer in other to allow the player to time its actions. Another feature is its ability to not interrupt other actions which the the user wishes to perform using its "lock" function which designates its automation to an app or resource.</p>
                <p>Tools: Manuludus is built using Python, with tools such as PyAutoGUI for input simulation, pynput for tracking user actions, OpenCV for computer vision, OpenAI's GPT for AI-driven automation, and Pandas for data analysis and action logging.</p>
            </li><hr>
            <li>
                <h4><b><u>OracLudi</u></b></h4> <p>OracLudi is a program that is built to assit the player like a gaming assistant, coach, team-mate and advisor. It is able to tell the player when to act, attack, go, what button to click, and also cook up strategies using its AI. It also is able to see the players health, energy and other in game accessories</p>
                <p>Benefits: OracLudi possess several benefits such as being able to provide the player with strategies, tips and tricks. It also has a feature that allows the player to learn from it and therefore guides the player especially novices.</p>
                <p>Features: The program is able to do so by using its API to search the web for tutorials, guides and other resources and information related to the game in order to form a satisfactory library of information and therefore dish it out to the player in-game. For example, say I am playing Minecraft for example, I can be playing and get warned of a hostile mob creeping up on me, when crafting I can ask it for teh recipe and so forth.</p>
                <p>Tools: By integrating web search APIs like Google Custom Search with web scraping libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup), employing NLP models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 for summarizing and contextualizing data, and utilizing in-game overlay frameworks like Overwolf—all implemented in Python; OracLudi  dynamically gathers and delivers game-related tutorials, guides, and alerts to players in real time.</p>
