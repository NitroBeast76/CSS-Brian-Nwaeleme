        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Manuludus: Manuludus is a program that is built to simulate the actions a gamer performs on a daily. It is desgined to observe the player's actions such as clicking, moving, using and pressing buttons etc, and then automates them. It also has an inbuilt GPT which when accessed is used to produce algorithms that will essentially allow the player to go on autopilot for as long as he/she wishes</p>
